# Movie App
A movie discovery app built in react. This app will display movies in a grid and give the user more information when they click on one of the posters.

## Features
- On the initial visit to the site, it will show the most recent movies.
- Allow users to put in a search term and display matches from the movie database in the same grid.
    - Matches should come from an API call, not filtering prior downloaded results.
- When a user clicks on one of the cards, open a modal and display more information about the movie.
